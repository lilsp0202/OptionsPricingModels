# Options Pricing Tool: Binomial, Black-Scholes, and Monte Carlo Models

## Project Overview

This repository contains a powerful finance tool that implements three fundamental options pricing models: Binomial, Black-Scholes, and Monte Carlo simulations. Designed for finance professionals, traders, and students, this tool provides a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for comparing and analyzing the pricing of call and put options across these models.


## Features
- **Three Pricing Models:** Includes implementations of the Binomial model, Black-Scholes model, and Monte Carlo simulation method for options pricing.
- **Interactive GUI:** A sleek and intuitive graphical interface allows users to input option parameters, select the desired pricing model, and view results in a comparative format.
- **Model Comparison:** Easily compare how different models price the same option, providing valuable insights into model behavior under various market conditions.
- **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis:** Adjust parameters like stock price, strike price, volatility, etc., and observe their impact on option prices in real-time.
- **Educational Resource:** An excellent tool for those learning about options pricing and the differences between various models.
